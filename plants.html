          <h2>Spiky</h2>
          <aside>
            I don't know if you could guess this. But this is my spikiest
            plant.

          <h2>Tall</h2>
          <aside>
            This plant is a real big boy. Thankfully he's a succulent
            so he needs less water!!

          <h2>Scraggly</h2>
          <aside>
            This is a real lazy looking plant. It's important to
            relax sometimes I guess...

          <h2>Leafy</h2>
          <aside>
            This plant's got nice green leaves. Someone's gotta
            photosynthesize around here.
          </aside>

          <h2>Sickly</h2>
          <aside>
            This plant really struggles. We're working on it though.
